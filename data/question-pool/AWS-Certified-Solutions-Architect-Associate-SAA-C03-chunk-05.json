When activated at night, the mobile app is sending collected data points of 1 kilobyte every 5 minutes to your backend.

Every morning, you scan the table to extract and aggregate last night's data on a per user basis, and store the results in Amazon S3. Users are notified via Amazon SNS mobile push notifications that new data is available, which is parsed and visualized by the mobile app. Currently you have around 100k users who are mostly based out of North America.
